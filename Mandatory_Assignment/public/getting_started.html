        Moving onto VS code, right after opening the VS code you will get a welcome text which you just cancel then as you have already set up your directory. You can right click and create your new folder give the name that you want. In my case, I created a folder named Node.js and inside that folder create a file test.js. Inside the file we write codes that we want to execute. For example, console.log (“hey I am writing some documentation”).  We run our code through terminal, so if you look up in the screen you can see the terminal open it and go into the current working directory which you have set up before.
        Then node (file name) example:<b>node test.js</b>
        It will run your code and you should be able to see the output.
        So, its basically how you get started with the VS code and run your first test.js file.
        To share and save your codes, create a GitHub account and create a repository. 
        To push your code to GitHub, you go to vs terminal and <br>
        <b>Git add -A:</b> <i>which adds your files.</i><br>
        <b>Git commit -m “Type your message”:</b> <i>about what you made changes in the code </i> <br>
        <b>Git push: </b> <i>pushes your code into your repository.</i> <br><br>

        <b>Tools  and techniques  used </b><br>
        <b><i>Nodemon:</i></b> Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node .<br>
