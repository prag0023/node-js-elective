        So, let us begin with what is node.js and its applications.
        Node.js is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is a light, scalable, and cross -platform way to execute code. It is primarily used for non -blocking, event driven servers, due to its single threaded nature. It is used for building traditional websites and back-end API services. Node.js is not a programming language, but it allows developers to use JavaScript which allows users to build web applications

         <h3>"Environment Setup"</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right:10px ; text-align:justify;line-height: 2; font-size:large;;">
        To begin with node.js you need some software to write, execute and run the codes. In our case we are using:<br>
        Node.js: runtime environment .
        Vs: It is a cross platform used to writing and testing codes.
        First, we need to download node.js and Visual Studio Code. So, to download node.js we go to (node.js.org) and download the latest version. Then, we download the vs code by (code.visualstudio.com).
        To check whether our node.js is correctly downloaded or not we got to our terminal and check the version.<br> 
        <b>node –version</b> when we enter it should show the version you downloaded .in my case it shows 14.15.1 <br>
        then we update npm(node package manager) by <b>npm- update</b>
        Now we set up our working directory in local machine.
         Then environment that we need is set up.
