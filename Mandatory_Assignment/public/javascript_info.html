        <b><i>String:</b></i> It is used to represent textual data. It is a set of elements. We can create two types of string concatenation and string literal. <br> <br>
        <b><i>Object:</b> </i>Objects is a collection of properties. It can be values of any type, including other objects which enables building complex data structures and are identified using key values which can be either a String or a symbol value. <br> <br>
        <b><i>Arrays:</b> </i>It is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by an index. It has two different characteristics. First, an array can hold values of different types and second the length of an array is dynamically sized and auto-growing.<br><br>
        <b><i>Call-back functions:</b> </i>Node.js is built upon call back functions. A call back is a function that we pass an argument in another function. <br><br>
        <b><i>Function:</b></i> They are first class citizens, and they can be passed as an argument.<br><br>
        <b><i>JavaScript variables:</b></i> It is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables and they are local variables and global variables.<br><br>
        <b><i>Local variables:</b> </i>They are defined inside a block or a function and is accessible within the function or block only.<br><br>
        <b><i>Global variables: </b></i>It is declared outside the function or declared with window object and is accessible from any function.<br><br>
        <b><i>JavaScript Loops:</b></i> Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. We have three kinds of loop: for loop, do while loop and while loop. But we aim to use functional approaches when looping like map, filter, reduce, find etc.<br><br>
