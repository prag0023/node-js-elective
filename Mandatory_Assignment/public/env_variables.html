        An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or micro service. 
        It is a part of the environment in which a process runs. An environment variable is made up of a name/ value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference point of time.

        From command shells, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via env or using the <b>ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE -COMMAND-</b>notation. 
        A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.
        Environment variable are fundamental part of developing with Node.js, allowing your app to behave differently based on the environment you want to run in.

        <b> <i >Why use environment variables?</b></i><br>
        Making your app run on any computer or cloud because they externalize all environment specific aspects of your app and keep it encapsulated. Because of it you can run your app just by modifying environment variables without changing the code and without rebuilding it.<br><br>
        
        <b> <i>When to use it?</b></i><br>
        Any place in code that will change based on the environment.
        Some common scenarios are 
        HTTP port to listen on
        Path and folder your files are located in, that you want to serve
        Pointing to a development, staging, test or production database. <br><br>
